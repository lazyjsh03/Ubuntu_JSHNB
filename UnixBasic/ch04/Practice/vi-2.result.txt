The company picnic will be held on
July 27th at Booksin Park from 11:30 am 
to 4 pm.

Directions to the park will be sent
one week before the picnic.

The company picnic has always been a fun
and exciting event. We are planning many
wonderful and exciting events for both
adults and children. This year we hope to
have the best company picnic ever.
We need volunteers to organize the
food, games, music, and prizes. Please
contact me if you are interested.

Spouses, friends, and children are
welcome!
